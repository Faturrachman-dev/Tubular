**Summary of Task: Hiding an F-Droid App During Android App Development**

You are developing an Android app using the Cursor AI IDE, but an existing version of the same app, installed from F-Droid, is causing potential conflicts (e.g., package name clashes). To address this, you needed a way to temporarily hide or disable the F-Droid app without uninstalling it, ensuring smooth development and testing.

### Actions Taken
1. **Attempted Shizuku Setup**:
   - You ran the Shizuku setup command via ADB (`adb shell sh /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/moe.shizuku.privileged.api/start.sh`).
   - The output showed a successful execution (exit code 0), indicating the Shizuku service started correctly, enabling privileged operations without root.

2. **Used Amarok to Hide/Disable the App**:
   - You installed **Amarok** (an F-Droid app) and used it with Shizuku to hide or disable the F-Droid-installed app.
   - This removed the app from the app drawer and prevented it from interfering with your development version, avoiding package name conflicts.

### Goal Achieved
- The F-Droid app is now hidden or disabled, allowing you to deploy and test your development version from Cursor AI IDE without conflicts.
- The solution is reversible (you can unhide/re-enable the app via Amarok or Android Settings when done).

### Key Outcomes
- **No Package Conflicts**: Your development app can now be installed and tested.
- **Non-Invasive**: The F-Droid app’s data is preserved, as hiding/disabling doesn’t uninstall it.
- **Shizuku Integration**: Using Shizuku with Amarok provided a rootless, developer-friendly way to manage the app.

### Next Steps (If Needed)
- Verify the development app installs and runs correctly via Cursor AI IDE.
- Monitor for any issues (e.g., Shizuku service stopping or app visibility problems).
- When development is complete, unhide/re-enable the F-Droid app in Amarok or Android Settings.
