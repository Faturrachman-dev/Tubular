## Configuration Fix Log - May 30, 2025
- Fixed Java configuration:
  - Identified correct JDK path: `F:\Program Files (x86)\jdk-17`
  - Updated `local.properties` and `gradle.properties` with the correct path
  - Verified Gradle works with `.\gradlew --version`
- Fixed app launch configuration:
  - Updated `.vscode/launch.json` to include:
    - `"packageName": "org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug"`
    - `"activityName": "org.schabi.newpipe.MainActivity"`
    - `"noDebug": true` (prevent waiting for debugger)
  - Modified `app/build.gradle` to set `debuggable false` for debug builds
  - These changes resolved the "waiting for debugger" issue

## Package Name Clarification - May 30, 2025
- Tubular inherits the internal namespace from NewPipe: `org.schabi.newpipe`
- The application ID is customized for Tubular:
  - Release builds: `org.polymorphicshade.tubular`
  - Debug builds: `org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug`
- Launch commands must use both:
  - Correct format: `[applicationId]/[namespace].[ActivityName]`
  - Example: `org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug/org.schabi.newpipe.MainActivity`
- This syntax difference explains the previous launch failures

## Task Complexity Assessment - May 30, 2025
- Task: Fix app launch configuration and address debugging issues
- Determined Complexity: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement/Refactor
- Rationale: The task involves multiple components (launch configuration, USB connection, debugger settings) but has straightforward fixes that don't require architectural changes

## Current Project Status
- **Last Build Status**: ✅ Successful with `.\gradlew build -x test` (skipping failing tests)
- **Run Status**: ✅ App installs and launches successfully
- **Current Issue**: USB connection stability issues
- **Focus Areas**: 
  1. ✅ Fix app launch with correct format
  2. Resolve USB disconnection issues
  3. ✅ Address "waiting for debugger" issue
  4. Fix unit tests by adding missing resources
  
## Terminal Command Log - May 31, 2025
- ✅ `adb devices` - Device 0I73C18I24101774 found and connected
- ✅ `.\gradlew :app:assembleDebug` - Build successful
- ✅ `adb install -r .\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk` - Installation successful
- ✅ `adb shell am start -n org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug/org.schabi.newpipe.MainActivity` - App launched successfully

## Action Items
1. **Immediate**: 
   - ✅ Update launch configuration to use correct namespace
