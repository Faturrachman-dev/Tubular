## Configuration Fix Log - May 30, 2025
- Fixed Java configuration:
  - Identified correct JDK path: `F:\Program Files (x86)\jdk-17`
  - Updated `local.properties` and `gradle.properties` with the correct path
  - Verified Gradle works with `.\gradlew --version`
- Fixed app launch configuration:
  - Updated `.vscode/launch.json` to include:
    - `"packageName": "org.schabi.newpipe"` (correct package name)
    - `"noDebug": true` (prevent waiting for debugger)
  - Modified `app/build.gradle` to set `debuggable false` for debug builds
  - These changes should resolve the "waiting for debugger" issue

## Task Complexity Assessment - May 30, 2025
- Task: Fix app launch configuration and address debugging issues
- Determined Complexity: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement/Refactor
- Rationale: The task involves multiple components (launch configuration, USB connection, debugger settings) but has straightforward fixes that don't require architectural changes

## Current Project Status
- **Last Build Status**: Successful with `.\gradlew build -x test` (skipping failing tests)
- **Run Status**: APK installs but fails to launch due to package name mismatch
- **Current Issue**: App doesn't launch correctly, device connection stability issues
- **Focus Areas**: 
  1. Fix app launch with correct package name (`org.schabi.newpipe/.MainActivity`)
  2. Resolve USB disconnection issues
  3. Address "waiting for debugger" issue
  4. Fix unit tests by adding missing resources
  
## Action Items
1. **Immediate**: 
   - ✅ Update launch configuration to use correct package name
   - ✅ Add `noDebug: true` to launch.json
   - ✅ Fix Java configuration
   - Test launch with `adb shell am start -n org.schabi.newpipe/.MainActivity`

2. **Short-term**:
   - Stabilize USB connection
   - Resolve logging issues
   - ~~Move project to `C:\Users\Administrator\Tubular` to avoid permission problems~~ (Project will remain at current location)

3. **Medium-term**:
   - Fix unit tests by moving resources to `src/test/resources/`
   - Address Gradle deprecation warnings
   - Fix Mockito stubbing issues

4. **Feature Development**:
   - Add ReturnYouTubeDislike toggle in settings
   - Enhance SponsorBlock functionality

## VAN Process Status
