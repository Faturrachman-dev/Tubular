## Configuration Fix Log - May 30, 2025
- Fixed Java configuration:
  - Identified correct JDK path: `F:\Program Files (x86)\jdk-17`
  - Updated `local.properties` and `gradle.properties` with the correct path
  - Verified Gradle works with `.\gradlew --version`
- Fixed app launch configuration:
  - Updated `.vscode/launch.json` to include:
    - `"packageName": "org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug"`
    - `"activityName": "org.schabi.newpipe.MainActivity"`
    - `"noDebug": true` (prevent waiting for debugger)
  - Modified `app/build.gradle` to set `debuggable false` for debug builds
  - These changes resolved the "waiting for debugger" issue

## Package Name Clarification - May 30, 2025
- Tubular inherits the internal namespace from NewPipe: `org.schabi.newpipe`
- The application ID is customized for Tubular:
  - Release builds: `org.polymorphicshade.tubular`
  - Debug builds: `org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug`
- Launch commands must use both:
  - Correct format: `[applicationId]/[namespace].[ActivityName]`
  - Example: `org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug/org.schabi.newpipe.MainActivity`
- This syntax difference explains the previous launch failures

## Task Complexity Assessment - May 30, 2025

## Current Focus - June 3, 2025
- Task ID: T002 - Fix Unit Tests
- Status: IN_PROGRESS_IMPLEMENTATION (final fixes)
- Complexity: Level 2

## Unit Test Fix Implementation Status
Testing resources like `db_ser_json.zip` were not loading properly in tests, particularly on Windows systems. The approach we've taken is to generate test data programmatically to ensure platform independence. Current status:

1. ✅ Compilation issues resolved:
   - Fixed constructor matching with StoredFileHelper
   - Fixed return type mismatches for TestStoredFileHelper.getStream()
   - Fixed overriding issues with TestStoredFileHelper.close()
   - Fixed ZipFile constructor issues
   - Resolved JsonParser method resolution ambiguity

2. ✅ Implementation improvements:
   - Created proper SharpStream implementation that wraps BufferedInputStream
   - Updated ZipFile paths to match what ImportExportManager expects
   - Enhanced test assertions to check for specific error messages

3. 🧪 Test status:
   - 4 out of 6 tests now passing (3 passing + 1 skipped)
   - Remaining issues with 2 tests: 
      - "Imported database is taken from zip when available" 
      - "Database not extracted when not in zip"
   - The core implementation of platform-independent test data is working

4. 📝 Documentation:
   - Need to complete README.md for test directory
   - Need to create reflection document once all tests pass

## Next Actions
1. Fix the remaining 2 failing tests
2. Complete documentation of the platform-independent approach
3. Create reflection document when all tests pass
4. Archive the task when complete

## Key Insights
- Properly implementing interfaces in Kotlin/Java requires careful attention to all method contracts
- Cross-platform tests need careful handling of file paths and separators
- Mock objects must properly simulate all behaviors of the real objects they replace

## Platform Detection
- Operating System: Windows 10 (win32 10.0.19045)
- Shell: PowerShell (C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe)
- Project Path: F:\Program Files\Tubular

## Next Steps
- Determine why Kotlin annotation processor is failing
- Complete test execution to verify the fixes
- Document the final solution in a README for test directory

## Task Planning Log - May 31, 2025

## Plan for Resolving Remaining Unit Test Issues - June 3, 2025
Based on our progress so far, we've identified a clear approach to fix the two remaining failing tests.

### Error Analysis Strategy
1. Due to PowerShell console issues preventing error message viewing, we'll use alternative approaches:
   - Redirect test output to files: `.\gradlew test > output.txt 2>&1`
   - Examine HTML test reports in app/build/reports/tests/
   - Run individual tests with detailed output flags

### Likely Issues and Solutions
1. **"Imported database is taken from zip when available" Test Issues**:
   - Likely cause: Improper file path handling in ZIP or MockStoredFileHelper implementation
   - Solution approach: Enhance TestStoredFileHelper to properly handle stream creation and access

2. **"Database not extracted when not in zip" Test Issues**:
   - Likely cause: Journal files not correctly set up for validation
   - Solution approach: Explicitly create journal files before test execution

### Implementation Plan
1. First capture complete error logs to confirm exact failure points
2. Implement targeted fixes for each failing test individually
3. Verify with incremental testing to isolate issues
4. Complete final documentation once all tests pass

This approach should allow us to methodically resolve the remaining issues while maintaining the platform-independent design of our solution. 

# Memory Bank: Active Context

## Current Focus (June 4, 2025)

We're currently working on Task T002: "Fix Unit Tests" - specifically addressing issues with ImportExportManagerTest.kt and ImportAllCombinationsTest.kt that were failing due to resource loading problems.

### Progress Summary
- Successfully implemented a platform-independent solution using in-memory test data generation
- Completely rewrote TestData.kt to programmatically create test files instead of relying on physical resources
- Fixed TestStoredFileHelper to properly handle files across different platforms
- Fixed ImportExportManagerTest.kt with all tests now passing
- Made progress on ImportAllCombinationsTest.kt with most combinations now passing

### Current Issues
1. ImportAllCombinationsTest still fails when running all combinations together
2. Error logs from PowerShell are incomplete, making it difficult to diagnose the exact failure points
3. Specific combinations with vulnerable serialization may be causing failures

### System Information
- OS: Windows 10 (10.0.19045)
- Working Directory: F:\Program Files\Tubular

### Next Actions
1. Capture detailed error logs by redirecting test output to a file:
   ```
   .\gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest > test_output.txt 2>&1
   ```

2. Focus on specific failing tests:
   ```
   .\gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "org.schabi.newpipe.settings.ImportAllCombinationsTest.Importing all possible combinations of zip files" > specific_test.txt 2>&1
   ```

3. Fix remaining issues with test combinations in ImportAllCombinationsTest.kt
   - Add more error handling and reporting to TestData.createZipFile()
   - Ensure consistent behavior across all serialization formats
   - Consider isolating problematic test combinations
