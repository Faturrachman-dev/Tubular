# Enhancement Archive: Fix App Launch Configuration

## Task ID: T001
## Date Completed: May 31, 2025
## Complexity Level: 2

## 1. Summary of Enhancement
This task resolved critical configuration issues that prevented the Tubular Android app (a NewPipe fork) from launching properly on physical devices. We identified the correct package/namespace relationship, fixed the JDK configuration path, resolved the "waiting for debugger" issue, and ensured proper handling of the LeakCanary library in debug builds.

## 2. Key Requirements Addressed
- Fixed app launch by using the correct syntax of `[applicationId]/[namespace].[ActivityName]`
- Addressed the "waiting for debugger" issue by configuring launch.json and build.gradle properly
- Ensured the app runs properly on the physical device (ID: 0I73C18I24101774)
- Fixed Java configuration with the correct JDK path (F:\Program Files (x86)\jdk-17)

## 3. Implementation Overview
We discovered that Tubular has two important identifiers:
- Internal namespace `org.schabi.newpipe` (inherited from NewPipe)
- Application ID `org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug` (for debug builds)

The app needed to be launched with a combination of both: `org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug/org.schabi.newpipe.MainActivity`

- Key files modified:
  - `.vscode/launch.json` - Updated package name and activity name
  - `app/build.gradle` - Ensured debuggable was set to true
  - `local.properties` - Corrected Java home path
  - `gradle.properties` - Corrected Java home path reference

- Main components changed:
  - Launch configuration
  - Java environment settings
  - Debug configuration

## 4. Testing Performed
- Verified Gradle works with correct Java path: `.\gradlew --version`
- Successfully built the app: `.\gradlew :app:assembleDebug`
- Successfully installed the app: `adb install -r .\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`
- Successfully launched the app: `adb shell am start -n org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug/org.schabi.newpipe.MainActivity`
- Visually confirmed the app launches and runs without crashing

## 5. Lessons Learned
- Android apps can have different application IDs (for installation/identification) and namespaces (for internal code organization), and launch configurations must account for both
- When working with forked applications like Tubular (forked from NewPipe), understanding the inherited code structure is critical, especially regarding package names and activity paths
- ADB commands can provide direct insights that IDE configurations might obscure, making them valuable debugging tools
- LeakCanary initialization requires the app to be correctly configured as debuggable in debug builds

## Notes
- USB connection stability issues remain to be addressed in a future task
- Unit tests need to be fixed in the next task (T002)
