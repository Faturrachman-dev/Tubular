# Project Progress

## May 30, 2025 - Initial Setup

### Summary
Initial setup of the Tubular project in Cursor AI IDE. The project successfully builds with `.\gradlew build -x test` but has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. The app fails to launch on the physical device due to package name mismatch
2. There are USB connectivity issues causing instability
3. The app gets stuck "waiting for debugger" even when not in debug mode
4. Unit tests are failing due to missing resources

### Accomplishments
- Successfully built the app with `.\gradlew build -x test`
- Identified the correct package name for launching: `org.schabi.newpipe`
- Created Memory Bank structure with project documentation
- Analyzed the codebase and documented the architecture
- Set up task tracking for upcoming work

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate Focus**: Fix app launch issue by updating the correct package name in launch configuration
2. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Add `noDebug: true` to launch.json
   - Set up proper logging with `adb logcat > logcat.txt`
3. **Stability Improvements**:
   - Investigate USB connection issues
   - Consider project relocation to avoid permission problems

### Key Metrics
- Build Status: ✅ Success (with `.\gradlew build -x test`)
- Run Status: ❌ Failure (package name mismatch)
- Unit Tests: ❌ 14 tests failing
- Documentation: ✅ Initial setup complete
- Task Tracking: ✅ Tasks identified and prioritized
