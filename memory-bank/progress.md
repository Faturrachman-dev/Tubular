# Project Progress

## May 30, 2025 - Initial Setup

### Summary
Initial setup of the Tubular project in Cursor AI IDE. The project successfully builds with `.\gradlew build -x test` but has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. The app fails to launch on the physical device due to package name confusion
2. There are USB connectivity issues causing instability
3. The app gets stuck "waiting for debugger" even when not in debug mode
4. Unit tests are failing due to missing resources

### Accomplishments
- Successfully built the app with `.\gradlew build -x test`
- Identified the correct namespace for launching: `org.schabi.newpipe`
- Created Memory Bank structure with project documentation
- Analyzed the codebase and documented the architecture
- Set up task tracking for upcoming work

### Next Steps
1. **Immediate Focus**: Fix app launch issue by using the correct internal namespace in launch configuration
2. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Add `noDebug: true` to launch.json
   - Set up proper logging with `adb logcat > logcat.txt`
3. **Stability Improvements**:
   - Investigate USB connection issues
   - Consider project relocation to avoid permission problems

### Key Metrics
- Build Status: ✅ Success (with `.\gradlew build -x test`)
- Run Status: ❌ Failure (namespace/package confusion)
- Unit Tests: ❌ 14 tests failing
- Documentation: ✅ Initial setup complete
- Task Tracking: ✅ Tasks identified and prioritized

## May 30, 2025 - Configuration Fixes

### Summary
Fixed configuration issues related to Java home path and app debugging setup to address the initial launch problems. Also clarified the package name structure of the project.

### Accomplishments
- Fixed Java configuration:
  - Identified correct JDK path at `F:\Program Files (x86)\jdk-17`
  - Updated `local.properties` and `gradle.properties` with the correct path
  - Confirmed Gradle is working properly with `.\gradlew --version`
- Fixed app launch configuration:
  - Updated `.vscode/launch.json` to include the correct namespace `org.schabi.newpipe`
  - Added `noDebug: true` to launch.json to prevent "waiting for debugger" issue
  - Modified `app/build.gradle` to set `debuggable false` for debug builds
- Clarified package naming structure:
  - Internal namespace: `org.schabi.newpipe` (inherited from original NewPipe)
  - Application ID (release): `org.polymorphicshade.tubular` 
  - Application ID (debug): `org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug`
  - Launch command requires internal namespace: `org.schabi.newpipe/.MainActivity`
- Successfully built the app with the new configuration using `.\gradlew clean build -x test`

### Next Steps
1. **Test the fixes**:
   - Connect the device and verify it's recognized by ADB
   - Test app launch with the updated configuration
   - Verify the "waiting for debugger" issue is resolved
2. **Address remaining issues**:
   - Investigate USB connection stability
   - Set up proper logging with `adb logcat > logcat.txt`
3. **Plan for unit test fixes**:
   - Analyze ImportExportManagerTest.kt and ImportAllCombinationsTest.kt
   - Ensure test resources are properly accessed

### Key Metrics
- Build Status: ✅ Success (with `.\gradlew clean build -x test`)
- Java Configuration: ✅ Fixed
- Launch Configuration: ✅ Fixed
- Package Structure: ✅ Clarified
- Run Status: ⏳ Pending testing (device not currently connected)
- Unit Tests: ❌ Still failing (to be addressed next)

## May 31, 2025 - Application Launch Success

### Summary
Successfully fixed the app launch issues by determining the correct launch syntax that combines both the application ID and the namespace. The app now builds, installs, and runs on the target device.

### Accomplishments
- Discovered the correct launch syntax: `[applicationId]/[namespace].[ActivityName]`
- Successfully launched the app using `adb shell am start -n org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug/org.schabi.newpipe.MainActivity`
- Updated launch.json to include both elements:
  ```json
  "packageName": "org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug",
  "activityName": "org.schabi.newpipe.MainActivity"
  ```
- Built and installed the app with `.\gradlew :app:assembleDebug` and `adb install -r .\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`
- Verified the app launches and runs correctly on the device
- Updated all documentation to reflect the correct package structure and launch syntax

### Next Steps
1. **Address remaining issues**:
   - Fix USB connection stability issues
   - Implement better logging through `adb logcat > logcat.txt`
2. **Focus on unit tests**:
   - Create missing test resources
   - Fix Mockito stubbing issues
   - Run and validate tests
3. **Implement feature enhancements**:
   - ReturnYouTubeDislike toggle
   - SponsorBlock enhancements

### Key Metrics
- Build Status: ✅ Success (with `.\gradlew :app:assembleDebug`)
- Installation: ✅ Success
- Launch Status: ✅ Success
- Debugger Issue: ✅ Resolved
- USB Stability: ❌ Still needs improvement
- Unit Tests: ❌ Still failing (now the next priority)

### Insights Gained
- Android apps can have different application IDs (used for installation and identification) and namespaces (used for internal code organization)
- When launching via ADB or configuring launch.json, both elements must be specified correctly
- The format `[applicationId]/[namespace].[ActivityName]` is critical for proper launching
- VS Code launch configuration requires both `packageName` and `activityName` fields to be set correctly

## May 31, 2025 - Task Archived

### Summary
Task T001 "Fix App Launch Configuration" has been successfully completed, reflected upon, and archived. The app now builds, installs, and runs correctly on the physical device.

### Key Accomplishments
- Identified and documented the correct package/namespace relationship
- Fixed JDK configuration and launch settings
- Ensured the app builds and runs properly with debugger settings correctly configured
- Created comprehensive documentation for future reference

### Next Steps
- Address the remaining USB stability issues (T001.4)
- Implement better logging (T001.5)
- Focus on fixing unit tests (T002)
