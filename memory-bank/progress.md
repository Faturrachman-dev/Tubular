## May 31, 2025 - Application Launch Success

### Summary
Successfully fixed the app launch issues by determining the correct launch syntax that combines both the application ID and the namespace. The app now builds, installs, and runs on the target device.

### Accomplishments
- Discovered the correct launch syntax: `[applicationId]/[namespace].[ActivityName]`
- Successfully launched the app using `adb shell am start -n org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug/org.schabi.newpipe.MainActivity`
- Updated launch.json to include both elements:
  ```json
  "packageName": "org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug",
  "activityName": "org.schabi.newpipe.MainActivity"
  ```
- Built and installed the app with `.\gradlew :app:assembleDebug` and `adb install -r .\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk`
- Verified the app launches and runs correctly on the device
- Updated all documentation to reflect the correct package structure and launch syntax

### Next Steps
1. **Address remaining issues**:
   - Fix USB connection stability issues
   - Implement better logging through `adb logcat > logcat.txt`
2. **Focus on unit tests**:
   - Create missing test resources
   - Fix Mockito stubbing issues
   - Run and validate tests
3. **Implement feature enhancements**:
   - ReturnYouTubeDislike toggle
   - SponsorBlock enhancements

### Key Metrics
- Build Status: ✅ Success (with `.\gradlew :app:assembleDebug`)
- Installation: ✅ Success
- Launch Status: ✅ Success
- Debugger Issue: ✅ Resolved
- USB Stability: ❌ Still needs improvement
- Unit Tests: ❌ Still failing (now the next priority)

## June 4, 2025 - Unit Test Fix Complete

### Summary
Successfully fixed all unit tests in the Tubular project by addressing the issue with serialized preferences in the ZIP file generation. The specific problem was in the `TestData.kt` file where serialized preferences were being incorrectly added to ZIP files even when not requested.

### Root Cause Analysis
- The bug was in `TestData.createZipFile()` method where serialized preferences were being added to the ZIP file when `includeJson=true` regardless of the `includeSerialized` parameter value.
- This caused the `ImportAllCombinationsTest` to fail because it expected an `IOException` when trying to load serialized preferences from a ZIP file that shouldn't have contained them.

### Fix Implementation
- Modified `TestData.kt` to only add serialized preferences when explicitly requested through the `includeSerialized` or `includeVulnerable` parameters.
- Removed the conditional block that was adding serialized preferences when `includeJson=true`.

### Verification
- All tests now pass:
  - `ImportAllCombinationsTest` successfully tests all combinations of ZIP files with different content configurations
  - `ImportExportManagerTest` tests pass (or are skipped as designed)

### Lessons Learned
- Importance of carefully implementing test data generation to match expected test conditions
- Need for clear separation between different types of test data (JSON vs serialized preferences)
- Value of detailed error logs for identifying specific test failures
