### Summary of Conversations

#### Initial Setup and Build Issues
- **Objective**: You aimed to set up Tubular, an Android app, in Cursor AI IDE on Windows, using JDK 17 and Gradle, with a goal to run it on your physical phone to minimize computational load.
- **Initial Build Failure**: The first build (`.\gradlew build --warning-mode all`) failed due to 14 failing unit tests in `:app:testDebugUnitTest`, primarily `java.io.FileNotFoundException` (e.g., missing zip files in `ImportExportManagerTest.kt` and `ImportAllCombinationsTest.kt`) and `UnfinishedStubbingException` (Mockito issues). The project was located in `F:\Program Files\Tubular`, raising permission concerns.
- **Analysis**: The test failures were linked to missing resources (e.g., `db_ser_json.zip`) and incomplete mock setups. Deprecation warnings (e.g., `archivesBaseName`, `fileCollection`), Checkstyle violations (e.g., `VideoDetailFragment.java:1560`), manifest warnings (e.g., ACRA provider), and R8/ProGuard warnings were noted but didn’t cause the failure.
- **Temporary Solution**: Suggested skipping tests (`.\gradlew build -x test`) to achieve a successful build, alongside moving resources to `src/test/resources/` and fixing Mockito stubbing.
- **Next Steps**: Verify test resources, fix deprecations, and set up an emulator or device for running the app.

#### Running on Physical Phone and ADB Troubles
- **Goal Shift**: You preferred running on your physical phone over an emulator. The build succeeded with `.\gradlew build -x test`, but launching in Cursor failed with `ADB command 'host:transport:0I73C18I24101774' failed. Status: 'FAIL'`.
- **ADB Conflict**: The error suggested an ADB server conflict, likely from Android Studio or multiple `adb.exe` instances. Steps included closing conflicting processes, restarting the ADB server (`adb kill-server`, `adb start-server`), and verifying the device with `adb devices`.
- **Manual Deployment**: Suggested installing the APK (`adb install app\build\outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`) and launching (`adb shell am start -n org.polymorphicshade.tubular/.MainActivity`), but the package name was incorrect.
- **New Error**: After killing `adb.exe`, you got `connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5037`, resolved by restarting the server. However, launching led to “waiting for debugger” with a “Force Close” option, and the debug console showed limited output.

#### Debugging and Logging Challenges
- **Debugger Issue**: The “waiting for debugger” persisted even with **Run Without Debugging**, indicating a debuggable APK or Cursor misconfiguration. Suggested disabling `debuggable` in `app/build.gradle` or adding `noDebug: true` to `launch.json`.
- **Logging Problems**: `adb logcat | findstr Tubular` produced no output, accompanied by a USB disconnect sound, suggesting an unstable connection. Recommended redirecting logs to a file (`adb logcat > logcat.txt`) and checking Cursor’s Output panel (though the “Android” option was missing).
- **USB Stability**: Advised checking cables, ports, USB mode (MTP/PTP), and drivers to prevent disconnects.

#### Launch Error and Manifest Analysis
- **Launch Failure**: Manual launch failed with `Error type 3: Activity class {org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug/org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug.MainActivity} does not exist`. You provided `AndroidManifest.xml`, revealing the package as `org.schabi.newpipe` and the main activity as `.MainActivity` (fully `org.schabi.newpipe.MainActivity`).
- **Root Cause**: The launch command used the wrong package (`org.polymorphicshade.tubular.debug` instead of `org.schabi.newpipe`).
- **Current State**: The APK installs (`Success`), the device is detected, but the app doesn’t launch due to the package mismatch.

#### Development Goals and Workflow
- **Features**: You expressed interest in SponsorBlock and ReturnYouTubeDislike. Suggested starting with a ReturnYouTubeDislike toggle in settings, using Cursor Composer for assistance.
- **Workflow**: Recommended structured steps (e.g., adding debug logs in `Player.java`, tracking tasks in `tasks.json`, using Git).
- **Project Location**: Advised moving from `F:\Program Files\Tubular` to `C:\Users\Administrator\Tubular` to avoid permission issues.

#### Pending Tasks
- **Fix Unit Tests**: Move `resources` to `src/test/resources/` and resolve `FileNotFoundException`/`UnfinishedStubbingException`.
- **Address Warnings**: Fix Gradle deprecations (`archivesBaseName`, `fileCollection`), Checkstyle violations, manifest issues (e.g., add missing strings), and R8/ProGuard rules.
- **Move Project**: Relocate to a user directory and update `gradle.properties`.

### Key Actions Taken
- Successfully built Tubular with `.\gradlew build -x test`.
- Identified and partially resolved ADB conflicts, enabling device detection.
- Installed the APK on your phone, but launch failed due to a package name mismatch.
- Analyzed `AndroidManifest.xml` to confirm `org.schabi.newpipe` as the correct package.

### Current Challenges
- **Launch Error**: Needs correction to `org.schabi.newpipe/.MainActivity`.
- **Debugger Issue**: Persists even without debugging; requires disabling `debuggable` or fixing Cursor’s extension.
- **USB Disconnects**: Prevents reliable log capture.
- **Logging**: Requires stabilization and alternative methods (e.g., file redirection).
- **Cursor Extension**: “Android” option missing in Output panel; needs enabling or reinstalling.

### Next Steps for Your AI Assistant
1. **Launch the App**:
   - Use the correct command: `adb shell am start -n org.schabi.newpipe/.MainActivity`.
   - Update `launch.json` with `"packageName": "org.schabi.newpipe"` and `"noDebug": true`.
   - Rebuild with `debuggable false` in `app/build.gradle` if needed.

2. **Stabilize USB and Capture Logs**:
   - Check cable/port, set MTP mode, update drivers, and test with `adb devices`.
   - Capture logs: `adb logcat > logcat.txt`, then search with `findstr "Tubular" logcat.txt`.
   - Enable the Android extension in **Settings > Extensions** and check the Output panel.

3. **Add a Feature**:
   - Add a debug log in `Player.java`: `Log.d("Tubular", "Player initialized on phone at " + new java.util.Date());`.
   - Use Composer to add a ReturnYouTubeDislike toggle in settings.
   - Track in `tasks.json` and commit to Git (`feature/return-youtube-dislike-toggle`).

4. **Address Pending Issues**:
   - Fix Gradle deprecations and rebuild.
   - Resolve unit tests and move the project to `C:\Users\Administrator\Tubular`.

5. **Questions to Ask**:
   - Does the app launch with the corrected package?
   - Can logs be captured after stabilizing USB?
   - Is the Android extension working now?
   - Which feature to prioritize next?

### Additional Context
- **Date**: Current time is 04:40 PM WIB, Friday, May 30, 2025.
- **Tools**: JDK 17, Gradle 8.9, Android SDK, Cursor with `adelphes.android-dev-ext`.
- **Preferences**: Focus on physical phone, minimal computation, structured workflow.
