# Questions
what did you find from the file @test_output 1 and 2 ?
the edit_file tool is taking a really long time, just for adding 3 lines of text 
the final is just letting the problem persist ( skipped )
whats the difference between REFLECT and ARCHIVE phase

# Suggestions
when successfully fixing problems / making progress, update memory-bank ? (too much work for the AI)
    i hope there's a way to do it outside of using the AI on the IDE ( so less context-window used ), but it could be less effective since the summarizer AI doesnt have previous or the exact context of the AI Agents on Cursor IDE ( or is it? we can enhance the chat-extractor further ).
